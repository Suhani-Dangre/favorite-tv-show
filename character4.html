    <img src="koki.png">
<p> Koki is a member of the Wild Kratts crew.<br>
    She is a mechanic and computers expert, <br>
    and her main job is manning the communication<br> 
    systems of the Tortuga. Koki is leval headed, serious, <br>
    and easily annoyed, but she knows when to smile and <br>
    joke off. She is not afraid to fight back when <br>
    threatened and speak what is on her mind. A defining<br>
    trait of Koki's is her typically sarcastic tone, <br>
    usually taken in the midst of one of the Kratt brothers'<br>
    various antics. Despite this, however, she is still<br>
    competent at her job and does never give up easily.<br>
    If there is trouble, she gets right to solving it,<br>
    often coming up with clever solutions. Her loyalty and<br>
    hardworking attitude are two of the things that<br>
    keep the Wild Kratts crew strong and together.
