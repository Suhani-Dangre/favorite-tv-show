<img src="baby-tooth_kid-musky.jpg">
<p>The Wild Kratts travel to the Arctic tundra, where two very different but interconnected creatures live: 
    the thick-haired, sharp-horned muskox and its main predator, the pack-hunting Arctic wolf. 
    Chris wants Aviva to make an Arctic Wolf Creature Power Suit, but Martin wants a Muskox Power Suit. 
    Both Kratt brothers set out across the tundra to find their preferred animal, each trying to convince
    Aviva to program their chosen Creature Power Suit. However, when a pack of Arctic wolves threatens a muskox calf,
    Chris and Martin try to choose sides in the conflict, but realize that there really are no bad guys in a predator-prey 
    relationship-the prey are trying to defend themselves, but the predators must kill or die of starvation.</p>

<h2>Season 5 Episode 5 "Fire Salamander"</h2>
<img src="fire-salamander.jpg">
<p>While exploring the Black Forest in Germany, Chris and Martin are amazed to discover a black and yellow salamander 
    crawling out of the fire! They don't understand how this is possible, since salamanders need water - not fire - to live.
    It's a mystery that the Kratt Brothers are determined to solve and unravel the secret of the Fire Salamander.</p>
