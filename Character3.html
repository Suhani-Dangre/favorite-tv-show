<h1>Aviva</h1>
<img src="aviva.png" height="300">
<p>Aviva is a member and the third-in-command of the Wild Kratts crew.<br>
     She is a biomechanical engineer and the creator of all the Wild Kratts's<br>
      inventions, most notably the Tortuga, Creature Power Suits, and the Creature Pods.<br>
     Aviva is a strong leader and an active member of the crew. However, she can<br>
     take competitions a little too seriously, and can oftentimes be quite stubborn.<br>
     While she has been shown to be somewhat arrogant in her abilities<br>
     (no doubt due to her intelligence), she does care about the well being<br>
     of her crew and the animals they encounter, and she does not value her<br>
     inventions over her crewmates. Although often hard at work, she can <br>
     sometimes be lazy and feel unmotivated.</p>
