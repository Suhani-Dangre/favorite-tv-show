            Chris and Martin Kratt are brothers who explore the wild throughout the world to learn more about animals and 
            share conservation information. They have three friends who travel in the Tortuga HQ with them named Aviva, Koki and Jimmy Z.
            Aviva make the kratt brothers creature power disks to either save animals from the villans or learn more about other animals.
            The Wild Kratts often come face to face with the show's six recurring villains, who include rival inventor Zach Varmitech, 
            fashion designer Donita Donata and her henchman, Dabio, Chef Gourmand, and developer Paisley Paver and her henchman, Rex.
            All of the villans have no regard for the enviorment and consitatntly use the ecosystem and its animals for their projects.
